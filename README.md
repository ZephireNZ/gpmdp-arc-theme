Google Play Music Arc Theme

To use within Google Play Music:

- Enable `Use system window borders`, this will give a seamless look.
- Disable `Invert Tray Icon Color`, to match the Arc theme in the system tray
- Set `gpmdp-styles.css` as the "Main App" custom style, and `gpm-styles.css` as the "Google PLay Music" custom style

TODO
====

- Change GPMDP UI colors, especially in the settings
- Settings page

- Google user popup
